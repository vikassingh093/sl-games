		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Users in certain jurisdictions have a right to

		exercised in accordance with applicable law.</span></p>

		<h1><span>1.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span dir="LTR"></span><span>Information We Collect,
		How We Collect It and The Legal Basis for It.</span></h1>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>RiverDragon only collects Personal Information to
		the extent necessary to fulfil one or more of its functions and activities, and
		will do so only by fair and reasonable means. Generally, we will collect
		Personal Information directly from the users, but in some circumstances (including as outlined below),
		it may be necessary for us to collect information from a third party source.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The legal basis for collecting and using the information depends on what the information is and the
		context in which we collect it.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Generally, we’ll normally process your personal Information for legitimate interest of efficiently
		fulfilling our contractual and legal obligations, account management, management reporting
		(including at our corporate group level), market review and analysis, promotion of our products and
		services and business development. In some cases the processing is necessary to perform our
		contract with you (i.e., our Terms of Service) or to fulfill legal obligations, or to protect your vital
		interests or those of another person (for example, another user). </span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If we ask you to provide information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with
		you, this will normally be clear from the context in which we are requesting your information (for
		example, when we ask you to provide a username to access our Services, this will be to create an
		account for you in accordance with our Terms of Service), and, if not, we will provide an explanation
		to you at the relevant time. We will also make clear whether providing information is mandatory. </span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Every correspondence with you is logged and stored within our systems. when you provide us
		additional information other than the information mentioned in this policy (such as information
		revealing health or medical condition), you give us your explicit consent to process it for the intended
		purpose.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We do not sell personal information of our users and have not done so in the preceding 12 months.
		We also do not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes
		unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information from
		a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do
		ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only
		share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any
		third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. </span></p>

		<h2><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span dir="LTR"></span><span>Information About You That We Get
		from Third-Party Applications, Including Social Networks (like Facebook)</span></h2>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If you play RiverDragon’s games or access any of
		our other Services on connected third-party applications or connect our
		Services to any third-party applications, including social networks like
		Facebook, RiverDragon may receive certain information about you from the provider
		of the third-party application. The information we receive depends on the RiverDragon
		game you’re playing, the third-party application, your privacy settings and, if
		applicable, your friends’ privacy settings on that third-party application.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>For example, RiverDragon may collect and store some
		or all of the following information shared by the provider of the connected
		third-party application:</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>• your first and last name;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>• your profile picture or its URL;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>• your user ID number (like your Facebook ID
		number), which may be linked to publicly-available information like your name
		and profile photo, and your friends’ identifiers;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>• the user ID number and other public data of your
		friends;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>• the login e-mail you provided to that

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If you access our Services from a third-party
		application or connect our Services to a third-party application, you should
		also read that third-party application’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</span></p>

		third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party
		application to find out more about their privacy practices.</span></p>
		
		<h2><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span dir="LTR"></span><span>Cookies and Automated Information
		Collection</span></h2>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Like many websites, RiverDragon and service
		providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, store log files and use
		tracking technologies such as "cookies" to collect information. A
		cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or
		your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to
		a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service.
		Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for
		purposes such as improving the quality of RiverDragon’s Service, tailoring
		recommendations to interests, and making the Service easier to use. </span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Third party advertisers on the Services may also
		use, place or read cookies or other technologies as described below on your
		browser, and those practices are subject to their own policies. Cookies can be
		disabled at any time by changing your web browser’s options to stop accepting
		cookies, to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit or
		limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than

		remove flash cookies. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be
		able to use all features, portions or functionalities of the Service.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We and our service providers may also employ
		other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a
		certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels,
		which allow us or our advertising partners to advertise more efficiently and
		effectively by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages,
		identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other
		websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which
		help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load
		times.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We and our service providers use these log
		files, tags, and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of
		technical information, including: </span></p>

		<h2><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span dir="LTR"></span><span>How We Use Your Information</span></h2>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The main use of the information we collect, and

		and our users’ experiences;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>• to identify and suggest connections with other RiverDragon
		users and personalize our Services to you;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>• to enable users to communicate with each
		other;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>• to provide technical support and respond to
		user inquiries;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>• to protect the safety and well-being of our
		users;</span></p>
